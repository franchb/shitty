"""The lib/vterm boundary: the VT core includes only its own headers,
plt, libstd and system headers. Any mention of lib/shitty - by full
path or by a quoted include that only resolves there - is a violation.
The whole point of the split is that the core cannot see the GUI, the
fonts or the renderers; this check is the guarantee."""
